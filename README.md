Magento: Mage Markdown Module [Mâ†“]
==================================

![image](https://raw.github.com/SchumacherFM/Magento-Markdown/master/logo/magento-markdown.png)

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

- Full support of [Markdown Extra](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)
- Renders all CMS pages and all CMS blocks (Mage_Cms_Block_Block and Mage_Cms_Block_Widget_Block)
- Renders every transactional email as Markdown (or MD Extra)
- Rendering of catalog product and category short and long description fields have to be implemented in the phtml files by yourself.
- Integrates the [EpicEditor](http://epiceditor.com): split fullscreen editing, live previewing, automatic draft saving and offline support. [1]
- Drag'n'Drop, Copy'n'Past and classical file upload of images supported in textarea fields. [Automatic image uploading](https://developer.mozilla
.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) integrated (>=IE10, Safari 6.0.2, FX3.6, Chrome 7, Opera 12.02)
- Converting of HTML into Markdown. Client side via JavaScript.
- Preview mode either via on-the-fly of rendered markdown or its HTML or Live Preview of the current page by choosing the approriate store view
- Set permission per role under System -> Permissions -> Role that user can see different parts of the Markdown Editor

Full documentation of Markdown's syntax is available on [John's Markdown page](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

[1] Will be maybe removed in future versions

Why do I need this?
-------------------

Because you want to get rid of the TinyMCE and force your customer to use easy and limited syntax.

You can also edit your markdown text with external editors:

#### Mac OS X

- [Mou The missing Markdown editor for web developers](http://mouapp.com/)
- [Lightpaper for Mac](http://clockworkengine.com/lightpaper-mac/)

#### All platforms

- PhpStorm
- Sublime Text
- Cloud based: [StackEdit](http://benweet.github.io/stackedit/)

#### Windows

- [MarkdownPad is a full-featured Markdown editor for Windows](http://markdownpad.com/)

Configuration
-------------

All options can be set per store view.

- Enable or disable Markdown parser
- Enable or disable Markdown extra parser
- Set permissions per role in System -> Permissions -> Roles
- Set Markdown detection tag
- Hide Image Insert button
- Enable/Disable markdown rendering in email template
- HTML Source Preview Style CSS, choose one of ~20 different themes
- Markdown Preview Style CSS, choose one of 9 different themes
- Configure the CSS Style for all three preview iFrames
- Add path to css file if using in transactional emails
- Enable or disable Markdown EpicEditor (Default disabled)
- Enable or disable loading of the EpicEditor via click in a textarea field
- Full configuration for Markdown EpicEditor - add a JSON object in the System -> Configuration section
- Defining a custom upload folder for image upload. This folder will be created automatically and recursively
- Enable or disable HTML to Markdown converter reMarked.js
- Full configuration for converter reMarked.js. Add a JSON object in the System -> Configuration section
- Integrate Markdown into your own module by adding the layout handle into the System -> Configuration section

Every field which contains Markdown syntax must contain that detection tag otherwise it will not be parsed.

File upload via Drag'n'Drop works only if you click on the textarea field once. During drag mode a green border will show that file upload
via Drag'n'Drop is available. If you do not see that border during a drag then there will be no file upload.

Bugs
----

#### CSS in transactional emails

CSS is included in the transactional emails in their style tag. Maybe some mail providers removes that style tag
or cannot render it. So maybe there has to be some transformation that the CSS will be added
into each html tag attribute: style.

```
	<h1 style="font-size..."></h1>
```

Developer Usage
---------------

Anywhere in a .phtml file you can access the renderer via:

```
<?php echo Mage::helper('markdown')->render($_description, [array $options] ); ?>
```

If you need support for Magento Variables, including Images, you should render the original Magento output. For example, in catalog/product/view/description.phtml, one would use the following code to render markdown, including images and/or other Magento variables: 

```
<?php echo Mage::helper('markdown')->render($this->helper('catalog/output')->productAttribute($this->getProduct(), $_description, 'description')); ?>
```

Catalog product and category description fields have already enabled the markdown feature in the backend. For the frontend
you have to implement the above mentioned code.

CMS pages (instance of Mage_Cms_Model_Page) and blocks (instance of Mage_Cms_Block_Block and
Mage_Cms_Block_Widget_Block) will be rendered automatically but only if the detection tag is present.

Magento Widgets and Variables will be automatically preserved and correctly rendered:

```
{{(widget|config|media|...) ... }}
```

#### Configuring the Markdown parser for custom usage

```
$instance = Mage::getModel('markdown/markdown_render');
$renderer = $instance=>getRenderer();
$renderer->empty_element_suffix = '>';
$renderer->tab_width = 5;
$instance->setOptions(array(
    'force'          => FALSE, // force rendering even if not markdown
    'protectMagento' => TRUE, // protect Magento widgets/variables ...
    'extra'          => FALSE, // force rendering of markdown extra if true
));
echo $instance->renderMarkdown('text goes here');
```

#### Tips for parsing transactional emails with Markdown Extra

- Remove body tags
- Use ```<div markdown="1">``` including markdown=1 in other tags works not always properly

#### How to integrate markdown into my module?

...

#### Modifying the backend

You can add an event to the Markdown observer which generates the backend view.

```php
        Mage::dispatchEvent('markdown_merge_after_element_html', array(
            'instance' => $this,
        ));
```
